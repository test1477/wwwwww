For a simple testing NPM project, your `package.json` can look like this. It includes basic project metadata, dependencies, and a build script.

### **Sample `package.json`**
```json
{
  "name": "sample-npm-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A sample NPM project for testing JFrog Artifactory integration.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "echo \"Building the project...\" && mkdir -p dist && echo \"Build complete.\" > dist/output.txt"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "sample",
    "npm",
    "artifactory",
    "integration"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^8.52.0"
  }
}
```

### **Key Details in This `package.json`**
1. **Basic Metadata:**
   - `name`: The name of the project.
   - `version`: Project version, useful for tracking uploads in Artifactory.
   - `description`, `keywords`, `author`, `license`: General metadata.

2. **Scripts:**
   - `test`: A placeholder script to demonstrate a test command.
   - `build`: Simulates a build process by creating a `dist` folder and adding a sample output file.

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Adds `lodash` as a production dependency (a commonly used utility library).

4. **DevDependencies:**
   - Adds `eslint` for development (a JavaScript linter for code quality).

### **Sample Directory Structure**
You can add the following files and folders for a minimal project:
```
sample-npm-project/
├── index.js
├── package.json
├── dist/ (created by the build script)
└── .eslintrc.json (optional, for eslint configuration)
```

---

### **Example `index.js`**
Add a basic `index.js` file:
```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');

console.log('Hello, JFrog Artifactory!');
console.log('Sample lodash usage:', _.capitalize('hello artifactory'));
```

---

### How It Works in the Workflow
1. **Dependencies:**
   - The workflow installs the dependencies (`lodash` and `eslint`) from the Artifactory remote repository.
2. **Build Script:**
   - The `build` script creates a dummy `dist/output.txt` file to simulate a project build.
3. **Upload:**
   - The built project, including the generated files, is uploaded to the specified Artifactory repository.
