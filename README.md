The error you're encountering indicates that the npm publish command is failing due to authentication issues. To resolve this, we need to modify the GitHub Actions workflow to properly authenticate with JFrog Artifactory. Here's an updated version of the workflow that should address the problem:

## Updated Workflow

```yaml
name: Build and Upload NPM Project

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  JF_URL: https://frigate.jfrog.io
  JF_REMOTE_REPO: npm-remote
  JF_TARGET_REPO: npm-test-project
  JF_ARTIFACTORY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JF_ARTIFACTORY_API_TOKEN }}

jobs:
  build-and-upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          registry-url: 'https://frigate.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/${{ env.JF_TARGET_REPO }}/'

      - name: Configure NPM for Artifactory
        run: |
          echo "//frigate.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/${{ env.JF_TARGET_REPO }}/:_authToken=${{ secrets.JF_ARTIFACTORY_API_TOKEN }}" > ~/.npmrc
          npm config set registry https://frigate.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/${{ env.JF_TARGET_REPO }}/

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build the NPM Project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Publish to Artifactory
        run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JF_ARTIFACTORY_API_TOKEN }}

      - name: Verify Published Package
        run: |
          echo "Package published successfully to:"
          echo "https://frigate.jfrog.io/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/${{ env.JF_TARGET_REPO }}"
```

## Key Changes and Explanations

1. **Node.js Setup**: We've added the `registry-url` parameter to the `actions/setup-node` step. This sets up the npm configuration for the specified registry[1].

2. **NPM Configuration**: We've updated the NPM configuration step to set both the authentication token and the registry URL. This ensures that npm commands use the correct registry[1][2].

3. **Install Dependencies**: Changed `npm install` to `npm ci` for more reliable and reproducible builds in CI environments[3].

4. **Publish Command**: Simplified the publish command to just `npm publish`. The registry is already set in the earlier steps[1][2].

5. **Authentication**: Added the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable to the publish step. This provides the necessary authentication for publishing[1][5].

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the `JF_ARTIFACTORY_API_TOKEN` secret is correctly set in your GitHub repository settings.
- The `package.json` file in your project should have the correct `name` and `version` fields set.
- If your package is scoped (e.g., `@myorg/mypackage`), make sure the scope is correctly configured in your `package.json` and that you have the necessary permissions in Artifactory.

By implementing these changes, the workflow should be able to authenticate properly with JFrog Artifactory and publish your npm package successfully[6][7].
