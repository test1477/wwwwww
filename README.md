If the registry you want to fetch dependencies from is `npm-remote` (e.g., for installing dependencies), then you can update the `Configure NPM Registry for Artifactory` step like this:

### Updated Workflow

```yaml
name: Build and Upload NPM Project

on:
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual trigger of the workflow

env:
  JF_URL: https://frigate.jfrog.io  # Replace with your JFrog Artifactory URL
  JF_REMOTE_REPO: npm-remote        # Replace with your remote NPM repository
  JF_TARGET_REPO: npm-test-project  # Replace with your target NPM repository
  JF_ARTIFACTORY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JF_ARTIFACTORY_API_TOKEN }} # Store the token as a GitHub secret

jobs:
  build-and-upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16' # Use the desired Node.js version
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Configure NPM Registry for Artifactory
        run: |
          echo "//frigate.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/${{ env.JF_REMOTE_REPO }}/:_authToken=${{ secrets.JF_ARTIFACTORY_API_TOKEN }}" > ~/.npmrc

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          npm install

      - name: Build the NPM Project
        run: |
          npm run build

      - name: Publish to Artifactory
        run: |
          npm publish --registry=https://frigate.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/${{ env.JF_TARGET_REPO }}/

      - name: Verify Published Package
        run: |
          echo "Checking if the package was published successfully..."
          echo "Published to: https://frigate.jfrog.io/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/${{ env.JF_TARGET_REPO }}"
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **`JF_REMOTE_REPO`**:
   - Changed the `.npmrc` to point to the `npm-remote` repository for fetching dependencies.

2. **Install and Publish**:
   - Dependencies are installed from `npm-remote`.
   - The package is published to `npm-test-project`.

### Behavior
- Dependencies are fetched from the `npm-remote` repository.
- Built packages are published to the `npm-test-project` repository.
