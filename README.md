Certainly. Here's the updated script with SSL verification disabled and warnings suppressed. Please remember that this is not recommended for production use due to security risks.

```python
import requests
import json
from urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning

# Suppress only the single warning from urllib3 needed.
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings(category=InsecureRequestWarning)

# Artifactory connection details
artifactory_url = "https://frigate.jfrog.io/artifactory"
api_token = "your_api_token"

# API endpoint for searching artifacts
search_endpoint = f"{artifactory_url}/api/search/aql"

# AQL query to fetch all artifacts
aql_query = 'items.find()'

# Headers for the request
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "text/plain",
    "X-JFrog-Art-Api": api_token
}

try:
    # Send the request to Artifactory with SSL verification disabled
    response = requests.post(search_endpoint, 
                             headers=headers, 
                             data=aql_query,
                             verify=False)  # Disable SSL verification

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Parse the JSON response
        artifacts = response.json()["results"]
        
        # Write the artifacts to a JSON file
        with open("artifacts_export.json", "w") as outfile:
            json.dump(artifacts, outfile, indent=2)
        
        print(f"Exported {len(artifacts)} artifacts to artifacts_export.json")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch artifacts. Status code: {response.status_code}")
        print(response.text)

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

This script does the following:

1. Suppresses the InsecureRequestWarning.
2. Uses `verify=False` in the `requests.post()` call to disable SSL certificate verification.
3. Includes error handling to catch and print any exceptions that might occur during the request.

Remember to replace `"your_api_token"` with your actual JFrog Artifactory API token.

Again, I must emphasize that disabling SSL verification is not recommended for production use. It's a temporary solution for development or testing purposes. In a production environment, you should properly configure SSL certificates or use a trusted certificate authority.
